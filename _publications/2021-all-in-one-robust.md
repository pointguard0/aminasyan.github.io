This paper presents a new robust estimator called Iteratively Re-weighted Mean (IRM) which enjoys 5 key properties desired for a robust estimator: computationally tractable, equivariant under similarity transformations, have a breakdown point around $0.28$, minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factor) and asymptotically efficient. 
The results are extended for sub-Gaussian distributions, as well as for unknown contamination level or unknown covariance matrix.
