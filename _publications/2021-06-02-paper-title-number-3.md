excerpt: 'We consider the problem of finding the matching map between two sets of $d$ dimensional vectors from noisy observations, where the second set contains outliers. The main result shows that, in the high-dimensional setting, a detection region of unknown injection can be characterized by the sets of vectors for which the inlier-inlier distance is of order at least $d^{1/4}$ and the inlier-outlier distance is of order at least $d^{1/2}$. These rates are achieved using the estimated matching minimizing the sum of logarithms of distances between matched pairs of points. We also prove lower bounds establishing optimality of these rates.
