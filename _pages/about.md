I am a postdoctoral fellow at [CREST-ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/) funded by [Labex ECODEC](https://labex-ecodec.ensae.fr/) and hosted by Prof. [Arnak Dalalyan](https://adalalyan.github.io/).

My research interest lies broadly in the various aspects of mathematical statistics, especially high-dimensionnal statistics, robust 
statistics, minimax analysis, etc. My work focuses on studying both the statistical and computational complexities of some high-dimensional tasks in statistics.

Recently, I recieved my PhD in mathematics from [YSU](http://www.ysu.am/main/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Victor Ohanian. Prior to YSU I did my bachelor and master studies in mathematics in [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/) and [SkolTech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/), respectively. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vladimir Spokoiny](https://www.wias-berlin.de/people/spokoiny/?lang=0).
